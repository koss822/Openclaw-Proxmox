### Added
- **Admin user creation** — installer now asks for a Linux username to create with full passwordless sudo rights; this user is separate from the `openclaw` service account
- **SSH public key setup** — installer asks for an SSH public key for the admin user; key is written to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- **SSH hardening** — password authentication is disabled in `sshd_config`; only key-based login is allowed

### Changed
- **Removed `--no-sandbox` from Chrome** — Chrome's sandbox relies on Linux user namespaces. On this Proxmox host, unprivileged user namespaces are enabled (`/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone = 1`, `max_user_namespaces = 127591`), and the LXC container is created with `nesting=1` which passes these through to the container. Chrome runs as the non-root `openclaw` user, so it can create its own user namespace for sandboxing without needing `--no-sandbox`. The flag was removed from the `.desktop` file, CLI wrapper, OpenClaw `browser.noSandbox` config, and dashboard shortcut.
